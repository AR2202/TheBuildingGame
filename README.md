# The Building Game

A 2-D shape arrangement game as requested by my 5-year-old son.

## Usage: 

`stack build`

followed by

`stack exec`

## How to play:

The goal of the game is to build the house that is shown in the bottom right corner.
A shape is presented in the top right corner. Click on any field (with the left mouse button) to place the shape there. After you have done that, a new shape will appear. To remove a shape, click on it with the right mouse button. The game is finished when either the suggested house has been built - the game will tell you that you've won - or all fields have been filled without building the suggested house. Click on "next" to get a new suggestion for a house to build and start a new game.
